# Shck Tchamna Portfolio

Welcome to my professional portfolio as a Data Scientist and Community Leader. This project serves as a showcase of my skills and projects I have worked on as a Data Scientist.

## Projects

### Data Pipeline
In this project, I developed a data management system using Python and various orchestration tools to automate data collection and analysis.

### Integrated Workflow for Advanced Multimedia Processing
I created a Python suite to streamline video content production. This involved audio processing, video production, chunk processing, and YouTube scheduling.

### Machine Learning for Record Matching
This initiative utilized deep learning and the 'fuzzy_pandas' package to match records in a dataset.

### ML for Similar Search in Under-Resourced Languages
The project focused on developing a machine learning model to suggest search terms for under-resourced and tonal languages using Word2Vec.

### LLM for Under-Resourced Languages
This project aimed to develop a Language Model (LM) for the Nufi language, starting with predictive modeling and progressing to sentence generation.
